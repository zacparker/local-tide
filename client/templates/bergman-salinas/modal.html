      <p>Revolution is the physical place and Creativity the digital space.</p>
      <p>Our shoes. They are sometimes soft and sometimes hard. We forget we are in them sometimes.</p>
      <p>We downloaded and watched the final episode of 6 Feet Under in a hotel room in Taipei. We cried and then went out for soup with the song from the final montage in our heads.</p>

      <p>We read news about the Arab Spring in Egypt from our rented apartment in Ramallah in the back garden under an olive tree. We borrowed a high speed wifi connection from our neighbor. We read that Mubarak had shut down the internet in Cairo.</p>
      <p>We have an archive of thousands of emails from the 1990's and early 2000's that we will hopefully not have the time or desire to read anytime in the future, but that we haven't been able to delete.</p>

      <p>We owned the domain www.nobelprize.no where we made a yearly internet exhibition opening at the same time as the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo. The Nobel Foundation sent us "cease and desist" letters, but we ignored them and continued for years. When we left Norway, we abandoned the domain, content that archive.org had mirrored our activities on the Way Back Machine. When we linked to it a few years later, we saw that most works were not properly archived, as is the natural way of the internet.</p>
      <p>The internet is busy while we sleep.</p>
