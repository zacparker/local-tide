      <p>I’m always a place I don’t know (this, misremembered from Ed Steck’s The Garden). Or, to paraphrase Adrian Piper, place is a discrete form I can no longer recognize as being viable. More than any specific attachment, there is the feeling that I can’t remember ever being in only one place. </p>
      <p>Less than holding onto any discrete form, object or signal, I am attached to the idea of entanglement in a technical process, in what Gilbert Simondon calls a transindividuation relation<sup>*<sup>, as the basis for a positive incompleteness and unoriginality, a re-membering of relations of subjects and objects and artifacts in general.</p>
      <p>Any place is a memory of itself in motion/Any memory of a place is itself in motion</p>
      <p><sup>* For the philosopher Gilbert Simondon, individuation precedes the individual--ontology, the study of being, is replaced with ontogenesis, which sees individuals in terms of the metastable processes and common materialities through which they are constituted. "It is not relation to self that comes first and makes the collective possible, but relation to what, in the self, surpasses the individual, communicating without mediation with a non-individual share in the other." For Simondon, an individual always partakes of a share that is more-than-one, which is what constitutes the potential for an individual to go beyond itself--the positive incompleteness of the individual. "The elaboration of psychic individuality is transindividual… individual cannot psychically consist in itself." Accordingly, the technical relation is a transindividual one, involving both humans and tools--the biological and the technical exist in a relation of co-evolution, under the sign of nature. Simondon asserts the necessity to engineer this relation on the terms of equality, where it is understood that the machine shapes the human as much as the human shapes the machine.
