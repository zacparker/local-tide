      <p>When I discovered online 3D-model sharing platforms, a new world opened up. How amazing that all these objects would be accessible, manufacturable, editable, shareable; all kind of materials, dimensions, and temporalities made available through the simple act of digitizing physical conditions. As if everything existed once again, as if the world showed itself in a new state of matter. I knew this was something fascinating that I would work with my whole life. I had dreams about all kinds of objects floating in space in a slow motion explosion. Weightlessness and dimensionlessness are so interesting, I’ve started doing trampoline lessons to learn more.</p>
      <p>I 3D-scanned my studio because I didn’t know what else to scan, and it was easy and nearby. I used a prototype 3D-scanner, a handheld device with a special interface for real-time visualization of the reconstruction process. Its depth-perception technology is so advanced that it doesn’t work accurately yet, but this creates a specific aesthetic result. The “failure” of this technology creates another version of reality — or an 'explosion' of realities.</p>
      <p>The scanning process requires you to circumnavigate the objects slowly, dance-like, following their forms all around. It forces you to engage a different perspective, and perception, of your surroundings. The resulting digital object is a visible representation of the originals, but with a time sequence inscribed in its construction. The 3D-mesh consists of millions of vertices, lines and edges with no specific dimensionality. It shows the objects of reality as fragmentary, free-floating entities in deconstruction and reconfiguration, deploying into double, multiple layers, shades and ghost-shapes surrounding and merging in any direction.</p>
